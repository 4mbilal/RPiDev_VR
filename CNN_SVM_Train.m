% |imageDatastore| automatically labels the images based on folder names and stores the data as an |ImageDatastore|

% Load Pretrained Network
% Load a pretrained ResNet-18 network. If the Deep Learning Toolbox Model _for 
% ResNet-18 Network_ support package is not installed, then the software provides 
% a download link. ResNet-18 is trained on more than a million images and can 
% classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, 
% and many animals. As a result, the model has learned rich feature representations 
% for a wide range of images.

net = squeezenet%resnet18

% 
% Analyze the network architecture. The first layer, the image input layer, 
% requires input images of size 224-by-224-by-3 (resnet), 227-by-227-by-3 (squeezenet)

inputSize = net.Layers(1).InputSize;
analyzeNetwork(net)

% Extract Image Features
% The network requires input images of size 224-by-224-by-3, but the images 
% in the image datastores have different sizes. To automatically resize the training 
% and test images before they are input to the network, create augmented image 
% datastores, specify the desired image size, and use these datastores as input 
% arguments to |activations|.

augimdsTrain = augmentedImageDatastore(inputSize(1:2),imdsTrain);
augimdsTest = augmentedImageDatastore(inputSize(1:2),imdsTest);
 
% The network constructs a hierarchical representation of input images. Deeper 
% layers contain higher-level features, constructed using the lower-level features 
% of earlier layers. To get the feature representations of the training and test 
% images, use |activations| on the global pooling layer, |'pool5',| at the end 
% of the network. The global pooling layer pools the input features over all spatial 
% locations, giving 512 features in total.
